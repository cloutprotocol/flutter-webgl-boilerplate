  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/www/
    - lib/screens/googlemap/


    #   /tron screen
    - assets/tron/

#   /pwa screen
    - assets/www/pwa/

#   /pwa screen
    - assets/www/decision-maker/

#   /pwa screen
    - assets/www/astro/

#   /pwa screen
    - assets/www/animejs/
    - assets/www/animejs/anime.es.js


    #   /mobiletouch screen
    - assets/touch/
    - assets/touch/css/
    - assets/touch/images/
    - assets/touch/js/
    - assets/touch/js/libs/
    - assets/touch/js/libs/threejs/
    - assets/touch/model/

  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
